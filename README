Setup instructions:

The build script is based on Gradle, and can be ran via the provided 'Gradle wrapper' (the ./gradlew shell script) or from a manual installation of Gradle.

If Gradle is installed manually, the 'gradle' command can be used instead of the Gradle wrapper shell script './gradlew' in the instructions below.  Instructions for installing Gradle manually are provided below.

Components built from tarballs (not from Git) are stored in the CableLabs Maven repository.  A set of default read-only credentials are provided in the default gradle.properties file. Non-read-only credentials are only needed once the script has been updated to support publishing of components to Maven and you are going to publish a component update via the Gradle script.  Instructions for specifying your own credentials are provided below.

CVP2 Gradle build script configuration:

The root gradle.properties file stores directory settings used by the build scripts:
 - base_path: is a base directory relative to the $HOME directory
 - source_dirname: a subdirectory of base_path where components will be extracted or Git cloned and built.
 - install_dirname: a subdirectory of base_path where components will be installed.
 - Default CableLabs maven credentials (read-only user)

The 'external' subproject builds tarball-installable components retrieved from the CableLabs maven repository.  The external  gradle.properties file stores the specific versions of those individual components which will be downloaded from the CableLabs maven repository.

The gradle directory contains the Gradle wrapper support.

The remaining subdirectories contain gradle.properties files which store Git repository and branch information along with build-specific configuration settings.  All subprojects except for valadoc reference GitHub or Bitbucket repositories and specify the cbl_master/plugfest36 branch by default.

Installation:

 - Run './gradlew' to download all Maven-accessible components and clone all Git repositories.
 - Run './gradlew showPkgCommand' to display an 'apt-get install' command line which can be pasted in a shell in order to install package-available dependencies
 - Run './gradlew installDependencies' to install the Maven-accessible components
 - Run './gradlew install' to install all components from Git repositories
 - Run './gradlew generateEnvSetup' to generate an env_setup script in $HOME/(base_path) which updates environment variables to point to the $HOME/(base_path)/(install_dirname) directory as the install root

Optional Gradle download and installation:
 - Download Gradle from http://www.gradle.org/downloads
 - Extract the zip and add the bin path to the PATH environment variable
 - Create a $HOME/.gradle directory
 - Create a $HOME/.gradle/gradle.properties file

Optional Gradle configuration supporting retrieval of components from the CableLabs Maven repository:

 - Log in to https://community.cablelabs.com/mvn/webapp/profile.html using your CableLabs credentials
 - Click on your user name in the upper-right (Logged in as _______)
 - Enter your password in the 'current password' box and click the 'Unlock' button
 - Copy into the clipboard the value in the 'Encrypted Password' box
 - Add two entries to a gradle.local.properties file in the root project directory:
cl_repo_user=(your CableLabs user name)
cl_repo_password=(the text from the 'Encrypted Password' field)
 - Save the file
